  <h1>Welcome To My Pet Blog!</h1>
  <p>I have a pet male dog. His nme is Claus. He's a siberian husky who cost me so much but he is worth it.
    Having a siberian husky as a pet in a country which is in the equator was challenging at first due to the fact that huskies are adapted to cold weather, but with time he kind of adapted  into the tropics.  </p>
  <p>Huskies are naturally loud so if you don't like constant howling and singing they are not for you.</p>
  <p>Claus is also quite sassy but intelligent too. He likes to take controll and be an alpha even in situations that don't apply.
    They sleep a lot! but in general, Claus is a sweetheart and a good companion.
  </p>
  <p>Some of Claus' favorite  activites and toys are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>walking / running.</li>
    <li>sleeping</li>
    <li>Howling.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Ball</li>
    <li>Dinasor we named Olly. </li>
    <li>A chew toy</li>
  </ol>
