### This is my first few websites that I have coded, they all have different text but similar code.  
#### By Jessica Mwangi. 
## Description
This project is made up of three files ie, My first webpage, My pet and My favorite things.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* To ensure smooth working, you should have the following:
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place. }
## Technologies Used
{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}
## Support and contact details
{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}
